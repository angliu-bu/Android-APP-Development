Title: FairEmail, privacy aware email (maximum 30 characters)

Description: Fully featured, privacy oriented email app (maximum 80 characters)

FairEmail is easy to set up and works with virtually all email providers, including Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo!

FairEmail might be for you if you value your privacy.

<i>FairEmail is simple to use, but if you are looking for a very simple email app, FairEmail might not be the right choice.</i>

<i>FairEmail is an email client only, so you need to bring your own email address. FairEmail is not a calendar/contact/task/note manager and cannot make you coffee.</i>

<i>FairEmail does not support non-standard protocols, like Microsoft Exchange Web Services and Microsoft ActiveSync.</i>

<i>Almost all features are free to use, but to maintain and support the app in the long term, not every feature can be for free. See below for a list of pro features.</i>

<i>A lot of effort has gone into this mail app, which was developed to help you protect your privacy. If you have a question or problem, there is always support at marcel@faircode.eu.</i>
