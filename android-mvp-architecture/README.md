#### The app has following packages:
1. **data**: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
2. **di**: Dependency providing classes using Dagger2.
3. **ui**: View classes along with their corresponding Presenters.
4. **service**: Services for the application.
5. **utils**: Utility classes.

#### Classes have been designed in such a way that it could be inherited and maximize the code reuse.

### How do I use this project?
This is a boilerplate project aimed to help bootstrap new Android MVP Applications. Feel free to fork this application or use [AndroidStarters](http://androidstarters.com/) to create new app using this boilerplate.

# MVP template

When we follow any architecture pattern like MVP, MVVM, MVP clean, we always come across a small but repetitive task to create basic files like Android Activity, Presenter, View, Api models and then writing boiler plate code. This usually takes 1-2 hours for each single screen. To ease out work and save time We have created an automated template which will do above work in less than 20 seconds.

### How to Install

Find the template/MVPActivity folder under root directory of android-mvp-architecture app. Paste the MVPActivity folder at below location.
1. Windows - C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\plugins\android\lib\templates\activities
2. Mac - /Applications/Android/Studio.app/Contents/plugins/android/lib/templates/activities

Restart the Android Studio.

### How to use

Select the folder under which you want to create a new MVP folder. This MVP folder will contain Activity, Presenter, MVpPresenter and View class. For example, to create a new MVP folder under “view” folder, do as shown below.
